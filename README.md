## Run 'npm install' to install node package dependencies

### Server setup includes nodemailer settings

### Backend is deployed to Heroku

## Notes

- Entire portfolio was initially built to deploy on Heroku - successfully deployed client and server sides to Heroku together with the correct buildpacks, however I ran into some problems when trying to add a custom domain for free with Heroku so split the client and server.

- Client side is now deployed with Vercel.

- Nodemailer used on contact form and emails are redirected from my email host to my main email
